# Script to compress .wine folders in /userdata/roms/windows.
# The script will:
#   1. Scan /userdata/roms/windows for folders ending with .wine.
#   2. Let the user select one via a dialog menu.
#   3. Offer a compression option: TGZ (wtgz) or SquashFS (wsquashfs).
#   4. Execute the corresponding command and then rename the output file
#      to remove the .wine part (resulting in <gamename>.tgz or <gamename>.wsquashfs).
#   5. Optionally, offer to delete the corresponding .wine folder in /userdata/roms/windows.
#   6. Finally, return to the wine tools menu.
#
